# Python_WebScraping

## MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT
<br />The main goal of this project was to extract **US DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES TABLE** and **Percent Change in the Last 24 Hours** tables by using **Python** and saved this data as JSON as well as csv files.

## SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT
<br />Data class was used to hold data values. 
<br />Data was extracted by websites using request and BeautifulSoup libraries in **Python**.
<br />Data was written to JSON data format and saved in a folder. 
<br />In addition, data was converted from JSON data format to DataFrame by using **Python** (Pandas). 
<br />Next, DataFrame was saved as a csv file in a folder.

<br />All steps were described in [WebScrapingPythonExchangeCurrency.ipynb](https://github.com/Longwinter93/Python_Projects/blob/main/Python_WebScraping/WebScrapingPythonExchangeCurrency.ipynb)


## FINAL RESULT OF THIS PROJECT
<br />US DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES TABLE and Percent Change in the Last 24 Hours tables were successfully extracted and saved as JSON files, which are located in a [JSON files](https://github.com/Longwinter93/Python_Projects/tree/main/Python_WebScraping/JSON%20files) folder, and as csv files, which are located in a [csv files](https://github.com/Longwinter93/Python_Projects/tree/main/Python_WebScraping/csv%20files) folder.
